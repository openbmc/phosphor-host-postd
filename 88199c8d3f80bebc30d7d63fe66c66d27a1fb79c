      "message": "We\u0027re not necessarily dropping anything here. We\u0027re just taking a little break :) - something that might happen anyway due to other processes getting scheduled. Once the sleep is over, it\u0027ll pick up right where it left off. IMO hitting the rate limit doesn\u0027t mean that anything has gone wrong or needs to be logged.\n\nOn the other hand, the aspeed-lpc-snoop kernel driver will drop bytes if userspace doesn\u0027t read them in time - so that\u0027s where something could be logged if we wanted to be notified of it. But I also don\u0027t think there\u0027s any guarantee that the driver will see every incoming byte. The HW only saves the last two snooped bytes and if the IRQ isn\u0027t handled before more bytes are written then there will be silent data loss. So it\u0027s an inherently non-coherent or unreliable channel.",
