If \u0027snoopChannels.size() \u003d\u003d 1\u0027, I think line 100 would put the byte into the lower position and then you\u0027re going to byte swap it in 112, which would be wrong.\n\nPostcode \u003d 0xab;\nAfter 100, combined_code \u003d 0xab;\nAfter 112, combined_code \u003d 0xab00...00;\n\nCan\u0027t we just read this into the right position to begin with?  \u0027code \u003c\u003c (8 * (snoopChannels.size() - (i + 1))\u0027 maybe?",
