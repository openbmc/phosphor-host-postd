If \u0027snoopChannels.size() \u003d\u003d 1\u0027, I think line 100 would put the byte into the lower position and then you\u0027re going to byte swap it in 112, which would be wrong.\n\nPostcode \u003d 0xab;\nAfter 100, combined_code \u003d 0xab;\nAfter 112, combined_code \u003d 0xab00...00;\n\nCan\u0027t we just read this into the right position to begin with?  \u0027code \u003c\u003c (8 * (snoopChannels.size() - (i + 1))\u0027 maybe?",

      "message": "This function (le64toh) is from the original codebase.\nIt was added in the commit https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-postd/commit/6dac4c5e5529eac30c6c2d35db9023c9914cc798\nFor me it seems like it is necessary for the Nuvoton BMCs, for the systems where POST codes are multibyte, but come from the same LPC snoop channel. And the data comes LSB first, so we need to invert the data buffer to get a POST code. This patch keeps compatibility with this case.\n\nFrom my observations on ASPEED controller \u0027le64toh\u0027 doesn\u0027t affect anything.\n\nSo it seems like the error you describe would arise only in a Nuvoton controller when we set \"codeSize\u003d1\", but the problem is not in this patch, but rather in a aforementioned commit.",
