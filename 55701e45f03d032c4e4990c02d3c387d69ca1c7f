      "message": "One of my earlier patchsets made it optional and was removed after the review comments. The comment that i got was that we should remove an option which is not used. \n\nI have no strong preference on using \n\n#ifdef NO_SNOOP_SUPPORT\n  {\"device\",optional_argument, NULL,\u0027d\u0027 }\n\nvs \n\n#ifndef NO_SNOOP_SUPPORT\n  {\"device\", required_argument, NULL, \u0027d\u0027},\n\neither would do the job, but #ifndef option seems cleaner right ?",

      "message": "I think what Benjamin meant is (correct me if I\u0027m wrong): instead of adding a compile-time flag you could make the argument optional, and add run-time checks of the \u0027device\u0027 flag. That way you can avoid the need of #ifdef\u0027s.",

      "message": "That\u0027s my initial thought as well, but the only thing that concerned me was that, the code looks to be written in such as way that we exit when we does not see the snooping port, so i thought that was a requirement which is why i had gone for the #ifdef to remove that piece of code from compiling.\n\nBut if i that is okay, i have made changes to make it optional \u0026 pushed the patchset.I still could not get rid of the no-snoop meson option because the lpcsnoop.service.in file is hardcoded with -d option.",
